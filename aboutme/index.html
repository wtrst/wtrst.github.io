                Hi there!
                <br/>I'm Wataru Sato and Japanese front-end developer based in Vancouver. I had studied about science of imformation
                and media at Ryukoku University which is in Japan, and It was the very first oppotunity that I've known a
                pleasure and a difficulty to code a program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University, I had worked at Japanese IT services company for almost 4 years. I can't say that was a
                big company, but, that's why I was able to have several roles which are like front-end developer, back-end
                developer and data analyst, then it provided me many great experiences.
            </p>
            <p> Now, I'm in Vancouver, Canada as a student at Cornerstone International Community College of Canada. I like to
                meet new people and try new things and it was the biggest reason why I've studied abroad. I hope to be able
                to work in new country, new language and with new wonderful people.
            </p>
