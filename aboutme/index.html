            <p class="mgv-40">
                Hi there!
                <br/>I'm Wataru Sato, Japanese Software Developer / front-end developer based in Vancouver.
                <br/>I studied about science of imformation and media at Ryukoku University in Japan, and It was the very first
                oppotunity that I've known a pleasure and a difficulty to code a program.
            </p>
            <p class="mgv-40">
                After I graduated from the University, I got a position as a software developer at Japanese IT services company, and worked
                for almost 4 years. I can't say that was big company, but that made it possible to provide me many great
                experiences that I was able to have several roles like front-end developer, back-end developer and data analyst.
            </p>
            <p class="mgv-40"> After 4 years passed at that company, I eventually made a kind of big decision to study abroad.
                <br/>As a first step, I went to Cebu, Philippine to study English at boading language school for 3 months.
                <br/>And then, I finally got here in Vancouver, May 2017!
                <br/>I used to be a student at the beginning, I studied "Web and Mobile Application Development" at the college
                which has super long name "Cornerstone International Community College of Canada". After I've had several
                classes for a year, I was on Co-op program which student has to work at some company which has business on
                the same field as what we studied more than 960 hours in next one year. I was trying hard to look for any
                open position, and fortunately got a current role as a Front-end Developer at Bodwell High School.
            </p>
            <p class="mgv-40"> Now, I've worked for 1.5 years.
                <br/>I'm successfully done with my Co-op process and graduated from tha collage.
                <br/>On the Front-end Developer role, I'm responsible for many web app development projects, and even mobile app
                development as well, which I haven't done before on real job. Through those projects, I truly believe that
                I've been getting improve day by day. There used to be something that I couldn't handle or solve when I was
                the "new guy", but now, I can handle almost every requests manager make to me on time.
            </p>
            <p class="mgv-40"> Now I'm thinking like my decision to come to Vancouver was totally right. I've got such a lot of experiences
                in here. I mean it's not only like English or technical skill. I have tried many things that I have not tried
                before. I have thought many things that I have not thought before. I have faced many difficulties that I
                have not experienced before. I learned how tough and how inportant challenging new things, doing my hardest,
                and continuing that in last 3 years.
            </p>
            <p class="mgv-40">
                I won't forget about it and I'm still going to doing that in rest of my life, wherever I am.
            </p>
