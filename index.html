                        I'm Wataru Sato and Japanese front-end developer based in Vancouver.
                        <br>I had studied about science of imformation and media at Ryukoku University which is in Japan,
                        <br>and It was the very first oppotunity that I've known a pleasure and a difficulty to code a program.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from the University, I had worked at Japanese IT services company for almost 4 years.
                        <br>I can't say that was a big company, but, that's why I was able to have several roles which are like
                        <br>front-end developer, back-end developer and data analyst, then it provided me many great experiences.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p> Now, I'm in Vancouver, Canada as a student at Cornerstone International Community College of Canada.
                        <br>I like to meet new people and try new things and it was the biggest reason why I've studied abroad.
                        <br>I hope to be able to work in new country, new language and with new wonderful people.
                    </p>
